# Zach

Zach is the restricted, GitHub-mediated workspace control agent for this
workspace. It will accept only typed, governed operations and publish
structured receipts; it is not a general-purpose shell executor.

The name Zach is inspired by the creator's cat.

## Bootstrap commands

```sh
make dev
make test
make build
make lint
```

The current binary is deliberately limited to bootstrap health and configuration
output. GitHub App credentials, webhook secrets, deployment configuration and
the command protocol belong to later, governed work.
